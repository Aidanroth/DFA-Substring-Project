Aidan Roth and Christopher Roseberry

Problem 1: Aidan Roth wrote the functions to convert strings to integers, integers to strings, and to compute the
    deltas of the states and inputs. Aidan Roth and Christopher Roseberry worked together on the function to compute
    the number of strings of length n.

Problem 2: Aidan wrote the MinString function that attempts to implement breadth-first-search.
