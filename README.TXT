This consists of two programs:

The first takes an input string s and input number n. It then checks if all members of the alphabet {a,b,c,d} are in a substring of length n inside the s.

The second program takes as input a positive integer k, and a subset S of {0, 1, 2, · · · , 9} and implements BFS to find the smallest positive integer that is
an integer multiple of k, and has only the digits (in decimal) from the set S.
